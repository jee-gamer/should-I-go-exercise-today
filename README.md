## Project Overview
This project aims to help people decide whether or not they should go outside
to exercise based on the conditions like weather and the percentage of people who might go.
This will also show the relationship between the percentage of people going to exercise and the weather.

## Api to be provided to users

- Text Suggestion based on the data (Ex. You should go!: -description-)
- Percentage of people doing exercise at current time interval
- Max/Min/Average amount of people that exercise in the day
- Prediction of amount of people that exercise on time interval based on data fetched from api
- Number representing Heatstroke risk
